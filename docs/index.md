# Optical Phenomenon of the Nature

An optical phenomenon is any observable event that results from the
interaction of light and matter. Common optical phenomena are often
due to the interaction of light from the sun or moon with the
atmosphere, clouds, water, dust, and other particulates. One
common example is the rainbow, when light from the sun is reflected and
refracted by water droplets. Some, such as the green ray, are so
rare they are sometimes thought to be mythical. Others, such as Fata
Morganas, are commonplace in favoured locations. Other phenomena are
simply interesting aspects of optics, or optical effects. The colors
generated by a prism are often shown in classrooms, for instance.

## File Description

### Bird verses fish

This provides a description about the optical illusion caused by
refraction at the interface of air and water. The optical illusion
herein, resists one to locate the other's right position with respect to
itself. With this one can easily figure out the separation what the
bird or the fish would face, the apparent separation, when provided
with the real distances.

### Example Problem

A fish is swimming at some depth from the surface of an ocean. 
Straight-way above, a bird is flying at some height from the surface.

1. At what total depth does the bird locates the fish, intending to
   catch it?
1. At what total height does the fish locates the bird in order to
   escape?

Provided the refractive index of air is 1.00 and that of water is 1.33.

### Solution


```c

//Refraction at the interface of air and water causes optical illusion to the observer,
//locating an object from the other side of the interface.
//This program helps the observer to find out the apparent separation from the object where 
//the true separations are user-defined.   

#include<stdio.h>

int a, b;                  // 'a' is the depth of the fish
                           // 'b' is the height of the bird from the surface

float n1, n2, temp;        //'n1' & 'n2' are the refractive index of the given medium
float v1, v2;              //'v1' and 'v2' are the apparent distances

int u1, u2;                //'u1' and 'u2' are the real distance of the object from the observer


   int main()
{

 printf("Mention the depth of the fish from the surface\n");
 scanf("%d",&a);
 printf("Mention the height of the bird from the surface\n");
 scanf("%d",&b);
 printf("\n\n");
 u1 = a + b;               //'u'- real separation between the object and the observer is 
 u2 = a + b;               //     the sum of real distance (object from surface and observer from the surface)

 float n1 = 1.0;
 float n2 = 1.33;

 //BIRD_LOCATES_FISH
 {
 printf("Solution: In actual practice, the fish is at a separation of %d metres away from the bird.\n",u1);
 
 float v1 = (n2/n1)*u1;           // formula used to calculate apparent distance

 printf("          The bird locates the fish at a depth of %.1f metres from itself.\n",v1);
 
 }
      
 // FISH_LOCATES_BIRD
 
 temp = n1;
 { n1 = n2;
   n2 = temp;
 printf("          In actual, the bird is a separation of %d metres from the fish.\n",u2);

 float v2 = (n2/n1)*u2;         //formula used to calculate apparent distance

 printf("          The fish locates the bird at a height of %.1f metres from itself.\n\n",v2);
 
 
 }

 printf("Conclusion: Bird locates a fish farther from the fish's real position\n");
 printf("            while fish locates a bird nearer with respect to the bird's real position.\n");
 
 return 0;
}

```
