# Optical Phenomenon Of The Nature
 An optical phenomenon is any observable event that results from the interaction of light and matter.
 Common optical phenomena are often due to the interaction of light from the sun or moon with the atmosphere, clouds, water,     dust, and other particulates. One common example is the rainbow, when light from the sun is reflected and refracted by water   droplets. Some, such as the green ray, are so rare they are sometimes thought to be mythical. Others, such as Fata Morganas, are commonplace in favored locations. Other phenomena are simply interesting aspects of optics, or optical effects. The colors generated by a prism are often shown in classrooms, for instance.

## File Description

* Bird_verses_fish
```c
This provides a description about the optical illusion caused by refraction at the 
interface of air and water.
The optical illusion herein, resists one to locate the others right position with 
respect to itself.
With this one can easily figure out the separation what the bird or the fish would face, 
the apparent separation, when provided with the real distances.

### Here is a problem related to the topic:

* Problem:
```
    A fish is swimming at some depth from the surface of an ocean.
    Straight-way above, a bird is flying at some height from the surface.
 i. At what total depth does the bird locates the fish, intendingto catch it? 
ii. At what total height does the fish locates the bird in order to escape?
    Provided the refractive index of air is 1.00 and that of water is 1.33.
            
```
