# Optical Phenomenon Of The Nature
 An optical phenomenon is any observable event that results from the interaction of light and matter.
 Common optical phenomena are often due to the interaction of light from the sun or moon with the atmosphere, clouds, water,     dust, and other particulates. One common example is the rainbow, when light from the sun is reflected and refracted by water   droplets. Some, such as the green ray, are so rare they are sometimes thought to be mythical. Others, such as Fata Morganas, are commonplace in favored locations. Other phenomena are simply interesting aspects of optics, or optical effects. The colors generated by a prism are often shown in classrooms, for instance.

## File Description

* Bird_verses_fish
```c
This provides a description about the optical illusion caused by refraction at the 
interface of air and water.
The optical illusion herein, resists one to locate the others right position with 
respect to itself.
With this one can easily figure out the separation what the bird or the fish would face, 
the apparent separation, when provided with the real distances.
